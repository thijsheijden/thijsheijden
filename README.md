## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile!

## About me
- Studying computer science at the University Utrecht (the Netherlands)
- Currently working on my bachelors thesis. At the UU this is a group project for an actual client over the span of about 4 months. We are building a graph database visualization tool. The tool has a React frontend, written in Typescript, and features a microservice backend written entirely in Go. Messaging between services is done by RabbitMQ.
